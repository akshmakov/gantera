Day something.. or the other
Another day, another bodyguard job. Beats polishing my sword at least.
Have to watch over this stupid merchant." Yada, yada, yada I'm going to sell so much at this festival yada, yada". He talks too much 
As long as he pays up, I couldn't care less. Kor is calling, so I better wrap this up.

Tomorrow we go to the Spring Festival to sell our crops and firewood. Papa will be going, as well as my little brother.
Nobody better stare at my ears or my eyes. Everything's so boring here, I wish something would happen, I don't even care what at this point.
No matter what it is, it'll be better than farm life

Dear Diary!
Tomorrow I'll be heading into town! According to the people I played for at the last bar, there's going to be a festival there!
I can't wait! I'll sing and dance, and everyone will sit and listen. I bet none of them have heard my type of music before!
Nothing can go wrong tomorrow, I just know it!

Our story begins the typical way, which is to say quite untypcial for people's daily lives. There was a festival, a time for merriment
and joy, to sell goods. In the boring life of a farmer, almost anything can be seen as an event. There had been talk of some thief prowling
around, the Red Hood as they were called, so some guards were at hand to watch out for any troublemakers. What would occur, however, was beyond
the belief of anyone there. A bandit attack! How could something like this happen in such a sleepy, boring town? People panicked and ran as 
the vile curs ran amuck. In the chaos, three individuals would prove their mettle. The first was a merchant's guard, who may have only thought
he was doing his job. The second was a farmer's adopted daughter who was protecting her family. The third a humble bard, who stayed and 
sang as those twice her size ran for the hills. The bandits were routed, and eventually fled but not without taking a grim toll


Things're fucked.
What the hell! I had a handle on things, but then that thrice-damned idiot went and shoved the merchant straight into a sword.
That's not even the hard part of being a guard! They don't even bother telling you that since 'don't kill your patron' is probably the
most obvious of obvious rules when it comes to guarding. Now I'm out of a job AND I've got people wanting to kill me

How could this all have happened?! It was supposed to be just another day; go to the festival, sell some goods, then come back to the
farm and eat dinner before going back to the routine. But bandits attacked! Actual bandits! Aren't they supposed to stay out in the woods?
What do we even have that they would want? At least I managed to protect my brother and some wheat dude.

Dear Diary!
Today was not what I expected at all! I was playing to the crowds (and they all loved me), when I got into a tussle with a thief! He was
quite rude, and I recognized him from posters... he was the Red Hood! He even tried to frame me for something! And before that was taken 
care of, bandits attacked! But with the power of teamwork, me and some others drove them off! This might be the start of something amazing!
