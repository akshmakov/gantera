Day something.. or the other
Another day, another bodyguard job. Beats polishing my sword at least.
Have to watch over this stupid merchant." Yada, yada, yada I'm going to sell so much at this festival yada, yada". He talks too much 
As long as he pays up, I couldn't care less. Kor is calling, so I better wrap this up.

1st of Autumnas
Tomorrow we go to the Spring Festival to sell our crops and firewood. Papa will be going, as well as my little brother.
Nobody better stare at my ears or my eyes. Everything's so boring here, I wish something would happen, I don't even care what at this point.
No matter what it is, it'll be better than farm life
-Janier

Dear Diary!
Tomorrow I'll be heading into town! According to the people I played for at the last bar, there's going to be a festival there!
I can't wait! I'll sing and dance, and everyone will sit and listen. I bet none of them have heard my type of music before!
Nothing can go wrong tomorrow, I just know it!
-Fuschia


Our story begins the typical way, which is to say quite untypcial for people's daily lives. There was a festival, a time for merriment
and joy, to sell goods. In the boring life of a farmer, almost anything can be seen as an event. There had been talk of some thief prowling
around, the Red Hood as they were called, so some guards were at hand to watch out for any troublemakers. What would occur, however, was beyond
the belief of anyone there. A bandit attack! How could something like this happen in such a sleepy, boring town? People panicked and ran as 
the vile curs ran amuck. In the chaos, three individuals would prove their mettle. The first was a merchant's guard, who may have only thought
he was doing his job. The second was a farmer's adopted daughter who was protecting her family. The third a humble bard, who stayed and 
sang as those twice her size ran for the hills. The bandits were routed, and eventually fled but not without taking a grim toll


Things're fucked.
What the hell! I had a handle on things, but then that thrice-damned idiot went and shoved the merchant straight into a sword.
That's not even the hard part of being a guard! They don't even bother telling you that since 'don't kill your patron' is probably the
most obvious of obvious rules when it comes to guarding. Now I'm out of a job AND I've got people wanting to kill me

2nd of Autumnas
How could this all have happened?! It was supposed to be just another day; go to the festival, sell some goods, then come back to the
farm and eat dinner before going back to the routine. But bandits attacked! Actual bandits! Aren't they supposed to stay out in the woods?
What do we even have that they would want? At least I managed to protect my brother and some wheat dude.
- Janier

Dear Diary!
Today was not what I expected at all! I was playing to the crowds (and they all loved me), when I got into a tussle with a thief! He was
quite rude, and I recognized him from posters... he was the Red Hood! He even tried to frame me for something! And before that was taken 
care of, bandits attacked! But with the power of teamwork, me and some others drove them off! This might be the start of something amazing!

Alas our heroes toil was to go unnoticed by the world at large (at least for now). While they had shown great fortitude in overcoming 
the bandits who had attacked the festival, they were not able to be immediately identified as the paragons of justice that they were.
A set of tests were declared, the winners of which would be lauded as champions of the realm as set to vanquish evil wherever it may
rear its ugly head. But our heroes would not be selected, indeed, it was another group that was marked for glory. Perhaps the fates themselves
intervened; for if these unsung nobles had embarked on this path, so much may not have occurred, to te detriment of our great realm. But Lo!
Their inner might was recognized by a elderly man named Aldrich, who gave them their first heroic task: to retrieve an item of great
importance from whence it had been stolen. On their way to to retrieve said artifact, they were set upon by a cowardly bandit, one of the
Brashers who had attacked them not a few days before. Showcasing their might once more, they subdued the treacherous bandit and restrained
him, not willing to be deterred from their glorious task. Into a dark cave they went, and in what would prove to merely the first of 
many brave acts, put rest their fears and divided into groups to faster find the artifact. Fuschia the bard slipped into a side crevice
and nimbly made her way through devious slimes, whilst Janier and Ragna made their way thought the larger cave. Eventually the three
regrouped, but not before having to vanquish scaled beasts that seemed to be loading crates, no doubt for some nefarious deeds. They 
reclaimed the artifact, called "Rupert" by Aldrich, and made their way out of the cave, unbroken but not unscathed.

What the hell.
We were sent to find a stuffed rabbit. A. Stuffed. Rabbit. WE NEARLY DIED TO FRICKIN' SLIMES TO FIND A STUFFED RABBIT.
If Aldrich doesn't give us some great reward, I swear I might cut his head off myself.
-Ragna

5th of Autumnas
I can't believe all that happened. Not only did we encounter one of the Brashers (and cut his damn arms off, that'll teach them to attack
helpless villagers), but we were attacked by slimes and some sort of scaly... things. WE got the old man's stuffed toy back, but why was
he so desperate to reclaim it in the first place?
-Janier

Dear Diary,
I am starting to think that some of my companions are angrier than is healthy. But I'm still sure that they're good people!
We managed to get an old man's doll back for him, away from the clutches of some terrible monsters! I'm sure he'll be very grateful
and even if he isn't, it's always good to do nice things!
-Fuschia


Shortly after completing their first noble deed, our champions three would meet another group that would join them in their heroic travels.
A barbarian woman, trained in the savage, yet frighteningly effective warfare of her people; a druid, blessed with an inquistive mind
that had been cast out by the academy for his love of nature; and a simple farmer's son, who preached peace at every turn. Together,
they would be more effective that ever. Returning to the city of Armden, they sought out Aldrich, to return to him what had been stolen
away. Before they could meet with him, however, their attentions were stolen away by a grand procession. It was the Sapphire Knights, the
realm's protectors, who declared they had captured vile Brashers who had managed to slay one of their own. While some of the party made their
way to the front, the crowd parting for them as if recognizing their importance, others chose to remain afar, content to let the crowd
see the Queen's jusice. Alas, it was if a cruel joke. The so-called slain Sapphire Knight was none other than the Brasher the original
trio has subdued before, and the so-called Brashers were innocent villagers, amongst them Janier's father. Forced to watch as they were 
executed, righteous fury burnt in the hearts of our adventurers, and they swore to set these deeds right. Shortly after the execution,
Janier was able to exchange last words with her father, and the group set out to find Aldrich once more. Their nobility was evidenced once
more as Ragna aided a young waitress named Marla with the burial of her brother, another vicitm of the Sapphire Knight's false justice.
With the return of Rupert, Aldrich sensed the touch of destiny on these six heroes, and bade them proceed to the town of Janno, where
he promised they would receive the answers they seeked. Indeed, Aldrich was so inspired by them that he lent them aid and tools of his 
own free will and bade them good fortune.
The path of Janno would not be smooth however, no sooner had out six heroes left Armden than they were set upon by Jax, a traitorous 
former friend to Ragna, who had thrown his lot in with the vile Brashers. Johnny attempted peace, but with their hearts filled with malice
the Brashers set upon out heroes unprovoked. It was only with their skill and might that our heroes prevailed, whereupon they treated
even the bandit dead with the respect that they deserved. Knowing that they would not feel proper with the Brashers on the loose, they 
managed to track down the den of the horrible Brashers. Down they went, into the bowels of the earth, eventually falling upon the horde
of the self-declared "Ser" Felix Darell. Their could be no other outcome than their glorious victory, once again, and as they surveyed
the site of their victory, perhaps that is when they first felt the stirrings of their great destiny.

How many headaches am I going to have?
We returned the damned doll to Aldrich, but in return we picked up three hanger-ons. Two of them at least seem like they can fight, but 
the last one seems kind of useless. I'm pretty sure he stole from various people, as well as the dead. Oh yeah, can't forget that,
looks like random people are getting executed for supposedly being part of the Brashers. Seems like Janier knew one of them pretty well,
as did Marla... helped her put her brother to rest as well. 
I guess I shouldn't be complaining about the new guys, since Janier has turned out to be a psychopath! We put down that coward Jax, and
then she decides to skin his damn face! I'm starting to think I never should have come along on this adventure, although at least I got
to put a bandit lord in his place. The barbarian was useful in that, seems she can really fight.
-Ragna

5th of Autumnas,
Why did they kill my daddy? He did nothing wrong! He was just a humble farmer... And they claimed that damned bandit was a Sapphire Knight,
when he was just scum. I will have answers. Nothing makes sense. Aldrich has promised answers if we go the port town of Janno, so that
is where we will go.
We have a couple of new companions now. If they can fight, they can come along. One of them doesn't look like he can fight but at least he
managed to raise some money for the horse. I will have my revenge everyone involved with my father's death. I have started with the one 
called Jax
-Janier

Dear Diary,
What are the knights of the realm doing?! They're supposed to help people, not brutalize them! Nothing makes sense. At least we managed
to get Aldrich's doll back for him. He seemed pretty grateful, but then insisted we take Rupert back and to some town called Janno.
I'm a bit unsure, but I know everything will work out!
-Fuschia

Johnny's Log
Managed to get far enough away from the farm today. I'm sure Lou and the others won't go this far to get back ~their~ I mean our cash.
It's not like I stole it. I just liberated it for a better purpose, me. Joined up with a couple of a barbarian lunkhead and some tree-hugger.
They're idiots, but the barbarian happens to be an awfully STRONG idiot, best play along for now. Met up with another group of ~fools~
good pals. Hung around with them long enough to pick some pockets and 'borrow' some cash from some criminals who got the axe (not like 
they'll need it). Not only that, managed to scam some senile greybeard out of a nice bag! Wins all around.
Might have to watch some things though, looks like the elfy girl has a couple of screws loose. She tried to shake me down for a horse.
And then later she skinned some guy! What the fuck! There's gonna be benefits for hanging around though, they took down some "bandit king"
and I knocked him upside the head. Bandits always got choice loot and I'm gonna make him spill the beans.

Experimental journal entry #207
The fools at the academy kicked my out simply because they refused to recognize my genius at fusing the natural world with the works of
men. Can't they see all the potential in the world around them? No matter, I am sure that my work shall prove my right in the long run.
For a while, I traveled with a woman from the wilds, and some lout from the countryside. He thinks he is much cleverer than he actually
is. I have since met up with another group of travelers and we agreed to join forces.
Alas, the town of Armden did not have the reagents I was seeking, but no matter, we were asked to travel to the city of Janno where
they will no doubt have more supplies. On our way there, one of our companions seems to have become psychotic, a shame. We decided to 
waylay our journey to teach our so-called "ambushers" a lesson. We gave them a dusting they shan't be forgetting soon.
-Jacques


Day 23 since leaving the clan,
I've been travelling through the wilds for some time now. Decided to join up with some town dwellers to get a better lay of the land.
First group wasn't much of anything special. A shifty weasel and someone who called themselves an "ahcahdemec". Whatever that is.
We were attacked by some kind of scaled vermin, and as one of them cowered, myself and the ahcahdemec sent the others fleeing. Joined
up with another group that seems to have at least one capable fighter.
For some reason, my new companions agreed to fulfill some old man's request. Might as well go along. One of ours seems quite driven now,
something must have happened at that big gathering. If it helps her fight, then good. 
We took down some fools who dared challenge us, then found their dwelling place and defeated their chieftain. It was a simple fight, my
axe longs for something greater.
