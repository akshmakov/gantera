Day something.. or the other
Another day, another bodyguard job. Beats polishing my sword at least.
Have to watch over this stupid merchant." Yada, yada, yada I'm going to sell so much at this festival yada, yada". He talks too much 
As long as he pays up, I couldn't care less. Kor is calling, so I better wrap this up.

1st of Autumnas
Tomorrow we go to the Spring Festival to sell our crops and firewood. Papa will be going, as well as my little brother.
Nobody better stare at my ears or my eyes. Everything's so boring here, I wish something would happen, I don't even care what at this point.
No matter what it is, it'll be better than farm life

Dear Diary!
Tomorrow I'll be heading into town! According to the people I played for at the last bar, there's going to be a festival there!
I can't wait! I'll sing and dance, and everyone will sit and listen. I bet none of them have heard my type of music before!
Nothing can go wrong tomorrow, I just know it!

Our story begins the typical way, which is to say quite untypcial for people's daily lives. There was a festival, a time for merriment
and joy, to sell goods. In the boring life of a farmer, almost anything can be seen as an event. There had been talk of some thief prowling
around, the Red Hood as they were called, so some guards were at hand to watch out for any troublemakers. What would occur, however, was beyond
the belief of anyone there. A bandit attack! How could something like this happen in such a sleepy, boring town? People panicked and ran as 
the vile curs ran amuck. In the chaos, three individuals would prove their mettle. The first was a merchant's guard, who may have only thought
he was doing his job. The second was a farmer's adopted daughter who was protecting her family. The third a humble bard, who stayed and 
sang as those twice her size ran for the hills.
