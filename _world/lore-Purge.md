# Ganteran Tales from the Past

## Garwind Decree of Purity, Edict 74a: No Quarry to the Wicked, The Purging 
*T*he Dominion of Garwind ruled over the realm for almost a thousand years. With its abundant fertile lands and flowing tribune, the growing Dominion diverted much of its resources to the expansion and preservation of might. Praising servicemen and war heroes beyond folklore and tales, Garwind adopted a democracy of military rule, wherein only those who served in the military earned the right to vote and hold political office. While many trades and practices were deemed prestigious, none were as revered as service in the military. 

Due to soaring competitive demand, only the strongest and privileged were able to train as soldiers. Many who failed to enter a sapphire academy or enlist in training grounds were left with no skills except their battle prowess. With the rise of gangs and violence, the Garwind high council unanimously passed an edict to banish all citizens who had no trade or profession.  The belligerent were casted out as unorganized brutes and thugs, only to be hunted almost as for sport by the knights in training. The weak and slothful were sent out as prey for all.
