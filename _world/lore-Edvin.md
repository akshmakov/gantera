## Defiance within the Dominion, the Rise of the Rogues, Edvin the Cle(a)ver, The Queen that Ended Two Kings
### Origin: The Dominion of Garwind, The Red Rogues of the Sunset

*N*o thug could single-handedly take on the well-equipped bandit hunters of the Dominion. Those brave or foolish enough to try found their heads mounted on spikes. The bodies piled for decades until 40 years ago when Edvin the Clever, sometimes confused as Edvin the Cleaver, became renown. 

Edvingard Devonshire was born into a prestigious house in the capital of Garwind. While destined to become a Sapphire Knight, Edwin instead had much interest in drawing, scheming, and simply getting into trouble. Amongst his escapades, Edvin took the blame for a thieving poor child. It was this last open act of disobedience that lead to Edvingard's exile; he was disowned, thrown out, and sentenced to be executed by the Azure guard on the 3rd sunrise: a tradition saved for traitors to instill fear as they suffered from exposure and abandonment. Unlike the common brigand, Edvin schemed. He used his time and wit to win the trust of scavenging bandits and began preparations. 

The third day greeted the waking sun with a delicate mist: a fog that Edvin used to his advantage. To deceive his predators, Edvin feigned being hit by an arrow by using a slain rabbit’s blood to leave an obvious trail that lead into the Burgundy Forest. The 13 inexperienced mounted hunters casually proceeded into the woods, however slowed by the terrain and morning fog. Then in a patched forest clearing, Edvin's bandits sprung their ambush. 

The horses stirred and heaved, tossing many novices from their saddles and left others amidst a disorientating chaos. The battle was decisive. Edvin spared only one knight. Before releasing her, he cleaved off her right sword arm, so that the story may be told of their defeat. King Solinde Tempest became furious and launched more hunting parties to kill Edvin, but each attempt failed horribly. The king felt helpless against hunting the bandits so instead he decreed that all merchants must be accompanied by armed escorts. With the hunts ceased, ruffians throughout the lands sang songs praising their hero, Edvin the Cle(a)ver, over the oppressive Solinde the Shamed. 

Years passed as Edvin established organized bandit camps and raiding parties. He established his own code, which prohibited the plunder of the poor and permitted any abandoned person, regardless of race, to seek refuge. He fell in love and married Barberi, an outcast shipwright's daughter, and founded Evaney, a remote fort town on the eastern coast of the Dominion.

The wary King Tempest did everything he could to attack Evaney; all the mercenaries he hired and fine knights he sent were killed or routed. Evaney with its traps and defenses appeared to be impregnable and thus the town continued its open rebellion by never paying a single copper to the Garwind tax. The King's trusted advisor, General Neston Gephar, did everything to spread propaganda throughout the realm which downplayed the shortcoming of battles and redirected to the wickedness of the bandits and cowardice of the mercenaries. While many continued to respect the strength of the Dominion, King Solinde himself suffered extreme depression and became bedridden from lamenting over his campaign failures. 

After King Tempest’s passing, his most cunning offspring, Silvara, sought to display her own prowess by leading an attack against Evaney. At the young age of 15, Princess Silvara hired thugs and peasants to infiltrate the Bandit Fort; she planted assassins and tradesmen to disable their defenses. A year after her scheming, Silvara openly decreed that she was ordained by the Wind Goddess herself to march a single battalion on Evaney. She announced that by the 7th peak of the sun, she would vanquish Evaney with an overwhelming victory and return with the Bandit King's head.  

Foreign leaders laughed at the young princess. Even her own people doubted Silvara, including her older brother, Waynard the Swift, the new king of Garwind. No one mocked her more than Edvin's generals, who jeered at the arrogance of the Dominion's ways but Edvin was ever careful. Upon ordering his troops to inspect the defenses, Edvin became fearful. To his dismay, all the traps had been sabotaged, walls had chippings, and woodwork was overcome with rot.  

Edvin did not notify his generals with fear of breaking their morale. Instead, Edvin hastily ordered his finest masons and craftsmen to gather materials to repair what traps they could. With much of his forces away gathering resources, the assassins struck in the darkness of night.  Each of the Evaney generals were slaughtered in their sleep or died reaching for a weapon. 

With Edvin's dying breath, he ordered his wife to take every remaining person and set sail to the open sea. The bandits became riotous: many refused to listen to Barberi and her loyalists while others quarreled for power. On the preordained day, Silvara and her army marched to the gates of Evaney, only to find the town defended by a quarreling and unprepared skeleton force. Silvara torched Evaney and returned home with her unscathed army and a single trophy, Edvin's head.
