# Ganteran Tales from the Past

## Legend of the Storm and Blight, The Unification War, The Flawless Sapphire Chronicles
### Origin: The Dominion of Garwind
*F*ive kingdoms fought to claim control over the realm of Gantera. Alliances, intrigue, betrayal, and spilled blood led to decades of war. In the years of open war, the Dynasty of Humans vowed to protect their pacifist Gnomish allies from any invaders. In return, the Gnomes fed their human allies with the Gnomish bountiful harvests. 

It was Sapphire Knight Frederica Garmund who discovered the Gnomes true power that lead to the fertile lands: the mystical energy of Emza. Teaming with curiosity and admiration, Frederica convinced the Gnome Elder Philibert Holklore to teach her the use of Emza. Being an astute paladin, Frederica combined her discipline from the holy order with her creative brilliance to yield unfound results. Garmund's experimentations eventually surpassed the applied knowledge of the Gnomes and led to her ability to transform animals and people into supernatural, fearsome creatures. 

Garmund first tested her knowledge of Emza in the battle of Knorhill, where her own lieutenant single-handedly slew an entire battalion of Orcs. The Orc Chief, Drog Xomath the Destroyer, learned of mystical phenomenon and in desperation, diverted his main battle force to the Lowlands to purge the keepers of Emza. While he successfully ravaged and burned the entire land of the Gnomes, Garmundâ€™s regiment pincered Xomath. It was in this confrontation that Frederica tested her own fortitude and transformed herself into a terrifying gigantic winged snake.  

Legend tells of a flying wind serpent, revered as 'Zephyria' or 'Goddess of Wind', that disintegrated the Orcish war machines and armor with its galeforce. Without a path of retreat and on the low-ground, Xomath and his army were left defenseless against the shower of arrows from Garmund's longbowmen. This was the beginning of the Orc lore known as 'The Day the Sun Went Dark'. 

After Xomath's death, the remaining Orc armies scattered back to their hardened strongholds, only to witness the desecration of their lands. Zephyria's freezing breath transformed the Orcish savannahs into tundra and drove off their hunting herds. The last of the Orcs were faced with the grim fate of starvation, slavery, or death. Word travelled quickly throughout the realm as militants and citizens alike became consumed with uncertainty and fear. The humans won continuous victories over their demoralized foes. One by one, the leaders of each kingdom bent their knee, sued for peace, and offered eternal tribune in hopes that they would not suffer as the Orcs.  

Frederica Garmund returned home victorious and became known as Heroine of the Realm; songs were sung of the 'Flawless Sapphire'. Shortly after the celebration however, Garmund fell ill as her lifeforce faded away.  The Humans blamed the Gnomes for poisoning their savior and killed every Gnome in the land. The secrets of Emza have been lost for over 800 years, but the tale is not forgotten.
