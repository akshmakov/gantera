title: The Kingdoms of Gantera

Introduction to the World of Gantera
### Long forgotten lore tells of the Ancient Ones...
who inherited the world from the Primal Beings. 
Through slavery and experimentation on the Primals, the Ancient Ones ruled mercilessly. However they too uncovered the mysteries of the universe. They learned to manipulate natural elements: shaping and misshaping life. They created vast landscapes and grand structures. They created magic. However, the Primals grew in number much quicker than the Ancient Ones. Eventually, the Primals fought and defeated the Ancient Ones to reclaim Gantera.

Through the Ancient Onesâ€™ fury, Gantera shattered and separated the Primals along with pockets of knowledge from the Ancient Ones. As each shard of civilization grew, their kingdoms harnessed the secrets of the past.

### For a thousand years, the land of Gantera once stood 5 kingdoms.
- The Dominion of Garwind: inheritors of Tactics and Guile
- The Republic of Kovendoor: inheritors of Elegant Art and Wisdom
- The Stormcliffs of Mirthal: inheritors of Metallurgy and Forged earth
- The Tribes of Sajh Beh Jind: inheritors of Architectural marvels and Ingenuity
- The Lowlands: inheritors of the Ancient Ones creation energy

But their isolation did not last long. Decades of strife and diplomacy between the kingdoms led to the so called *"Unification War"*. By the end, the people of Sajh Beh Jind were decimated from war; those who survived were enslaved. Soon after the War's end, the people of the Lowlands were slaughtered for assassinating the Garwind savior and champion: Sira Frederica Garmund.
