# Ganteran Tales from the Past

## The Ancient and the Primal, Birth of the 5 Kingdoms
### Origin: Ganteran Lore

### Long forgotten lore tells of the Ancient Ones...
who inherited the world from the Primal Beings. Though their origin is not known, the Ancient Ones enslaved and experimented on the Primals. The Primals were not seen as intelligent beings but rather as objects or livestock for the Ancient One’s desires.  The Ancient Ones possessed a lust for curiosity and discovery, allowing them to unveil mysteries of the universe. They learned to manipulate natural elements: shaping and misshaping life. They infused sensations, abilities, and emotions into creatures, including the Primals. They even built the world through emerging vast landscapes and grand structures. They created magic. 

Over centuries, the Primals grew in number much quicker than the Ancient Ones. Eventually, The Primals – lead by fabled leaders like Illanor and Golbez, fought to defeat the Ancient Ones. As a final retribution, the last Ancient Ones mounted their fury to shatter Gantera. Many of the Primals were incinerated by the tearing of the world; those who survived were separated along with pockets of ancient wisdom. As each shard of civilization grew, their kingdoms harnessed particular the secrets of the past.

### For a thousand years, the land of Gantera once stood 5 kingdoms.
- The Dominion of Garwind: inheritors of Tactics and Guile
- The Republic of Kovendoor: inheritors of Elegant Art and Wisdom
- The Stormcliffs of Mirthal: inheritors of Metallurgy and Forged Earth
- The Tribes of Sajh Beh Jind: inheritors of Architectural Marvels and Ingenuity
- The Lowlands: inheritors of the Ancient Ones creation energy, known as Emza

But their isolation did not last long. Decades of strife and diplomacy between the kingdoms led to the so called *"Unification War"*. By the end, the people of Sajh Beh Jind were decimated from war; those who survived were enslaved. Soon after the War's end, the people of the Lowlands were slaughtered for assassinating the Garwind savior and champion: Sira Frederica Garmund.
