# Ganteran Tales from the Past

## The Ancient and the Primal, Birth of the 5 Kingdoms
### Origin: Ganteran Lore

### Lore from the forgotten era tells of the Ancient Ones...
who inherited the world from the Primal Beings. Though their origin is not known, the Ancient Ones enslaved and experimented on the Primals. The Primals were not seen as intelligent beings but rather as objects or livestock for the Ancient One’s desires.  The Ancient Ones possessed a lust for curiosity and discovery, allowing them to unveil mysteries of the universe. They learned to manipulate natural elements: shaping and misshaping life. They infused sensations, abilities, and emotions into creatures, including the Primals. They even built the world through emerging vast landscapes and grand structures. They created magic. 

Over centuries, the Primals grew in number much quicker than the Ancient Ones. Eventually, The Primals – lead by fabled leaders like Illanor and Golbez, fought to defeat the Ancient Ones. As a final retribution, the last Ancient Ones mounted their fury to shatter Gantera. Many of the Primals were incinerated by the tearing of the world; those who survived were separated along with pockets of ancient wisdom. As each shard of civilization grew, the kingdoms harnessed particular secrets of the past.

### For a thousand years, the land of Gantera once stood 5 kingdoms.
- The Aeremyest Empire: inheritors of Tactics and Guile
- The Republic of Kovendoor: inheritors of Elegant Art and Wisdom
- The Stormcliffs of Mirthal: inheritors of Metallurgy and Forged Earth
- The Tribes of Sajh Beh Jind: inheritors of Architectural Marvels and Ingenuity
- The Lowlands: inheritors of the Ancient Ones creation energy, known as Emza

But their isolation did not last long. Decades of intrigue, strife, and tension amongst the kingdoms accumulated to the so called *"Unification War"*. By the end, the people of Sajh Beh Jind were decimated from war; those who survived were enslaved. The remaining kingdoms laid down their arms to the conquerer, the Aeremyest Empire. 

After the war, King Harond Tempos Aeremyest the 11th offered the crown to their savior and champion, Sira Frederica Garmund. The battle-fatigued but otherwise healthy Sapphire Knight answered the King’s summon and made her way back to Aerem Santus, the capital of the Aeremyest Empire. On her journey, she fell deathly ill from an unknown cause and died shortly after. The people of the empire mourned and revolted; they demanded justice for the death of their beloved Flawless Sapphire. 

King Aeremyest quelled the riots and reunited the citizens by offering noteworthy tributes in honor of Sira Garmund's sacrifice. He first named Garmund’s legendary dragon form, Zypheria, as ‘the Goddess of Wind’. Furthermore, King Aeremyest decreed that the Empire would be forever called ‘The Dominion of Garwind’. The people rejoiced at the prospect that they would be citizens of the Sapphire Knight. It was both commemorative and rallying. Since then, people throughout the realm proudly boasted to be citizens of the Dominion: the nation that unified the 5 Kingdoms under the leadership and might of Sira Frederica Garmund.

However, the suspicion and thirst for vengeance remained. To answer his people’s plea, King Aeremyest blamed the people of the Lowlands for poisoning and assassinating Sira Garmund. There was no nation left to hold back the enraged mob. The Lowlands were destroyed: each home was turned to ash and each inhabitant was slaughtered.
